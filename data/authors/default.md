Welcome to my site! I’m a Product Manager who loves building things from scratch. Most of all, I value learning and growing with people, teams and technologies.

Currently, I am working as a Lead Product Manager at [Airstream](https://www.airstream.com) where I am scaling our connected vehicle platform across all of our travel trailers with a focus on mobile app design, user empathy and cloud-native development.

I love AI/ML infrastructure and learning about the advances in MLOps. One of my favorite projects was when I led a team at Ford in building their first MVP of a Feature Store.

This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment with ideas and share some of my findings. It’s a reflection of my career path and interests - especially on the product side of things. For more information, check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautham-v).

Do you have a project in mind? Want to scale a product and looking to hire? or simply wanna chat? Feel free to [schedule a meeting](mailto:gvem@duck.com)
